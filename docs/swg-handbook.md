## Review Process

### PR Review Workflow

#### 1. Automated Validation (Required)
All PRs must pass:
- [ ] Schema structural validation
- [ ] Example validation
- [ ] Backward compatibility check
- [ ] OpenAPI linting
- [ ] Generated type compilation
- [ ] Version overlap validation (for deprecations)

#### 2. Technical Review (Required: 2 core members)
Core members evaluate:
- **Technical Quality**: Schema design, patterns, conventions
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility analysis
- **Impact**: Effect on downstream consumers
- **Documentation**: Completeness and clarity

#### 3. Domain Review (Required for relevant changes)
Domain experts evaluate:
- **Service Integration**: Effect on service boundaries
- **Data Pipeline**: Impact on ETL and analytics
- **Performance**: Scalability and efficiency implications
- **Security**: Data privacy and security considerations

#### 4. Breaking Change Review (Required: All core members)
For breaking changes, additional review includes:
- **Migration Strategy**: Feasibility and completeness
- **Timeline**: Reasonable deprecation period
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Effect on all consumers
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation

### Review Criteria

1. **Technical Discussion**: Open technical debate with data-driven arguments
2. **Stakeholder Input**: Gather feedback from affected service teams
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential negative impacts
4. **Alternative Evaluation**: Consider multiple approaches
5. **Consensus Check**: Seek agreement from core members

### Conflict Resolution

#### Level 1: Technical Disagreement
- Schedule dedicated discussion session
- Bring in subject matter experts

- Include Product Management if product impact
- Schedule longer resolution session
- May require executive input
- Document decision rationale

#### Level 3: Deadlock
- Escalate to Engineering Leadership
- Present all perspectives clearly
- Accept final decision from leadership
- Update process to prevent future deadlock

### Voting (Last Resort)
When consensus cannot be reached:
